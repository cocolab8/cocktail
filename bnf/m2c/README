Bnf - Transformer from EBNF to BNF
==================================

The common front-end (front) for bnf and lalr must have been compiled
before bnf can be generated. As bnf makes use of the library of reusable
Modula-2 modules (MLIB=reuse), this library must also have been compiled before.

To generate bnf use:

   make install LIB=... BIN=... OPT=...
