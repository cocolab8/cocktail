These are two Occam recognisers, defined with yacc & handcrafted lexers.
The Occam recogniser was developed as a lex & yacc learning exercise.
The one for Occam is unambiguous. The one for Occam2 is ambiguous and requires
work to tidy up the syntax. This is mainly because the Occam2 definition is a
rather unsuited for yacc, as defined by the Occam2 Language definition by David
May.

The most original part of this is the lex routines which deal with Occam's
indentation features. These recognisers are offered because periodically
I see people on the net asking for an Occam lex & yacc definition.

To build a compiler from this requires a LOT more work. I hope someone
finds this useful, however I do not intend to maintain it. Hence I am
placing this in the public domain.
