Transformation of Grammars from lalr Syntax to cg Syntax
========================================================

L2cg makes use of a library of reusable Modula-2 modules (MLIB=reuse).
This library must be compiled before L2cg itself.

To generate L2cg use:

   make install BIN=... LIB=... OPT=...
