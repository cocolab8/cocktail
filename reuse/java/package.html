<P>
Useful classes for building compilers using the Cocktail tool kit.
</P>
<P>Some of these classes are required by Cocktail generated code, while
others are independent components which have been found to be useful.
Similar code is available in other languages supported by Cocktail, and
compatibility with those sometimes prevents the use of Java naming conventions.
</P>
<P>The classes are grouped as follows:
<DL>
  <DT><B>Dynamic Arrays</B>
  <DD>In Java the size of arrays is specified when the array object
      is created.  Cocktail provides classes which can be used when
      the required size of an array is not known in advance.  One class
      is provided for each basic type, for example {@link de.cocolab.reuse.DynArrayByte}
      or {@link de.cocolab.reuse.DynArrayObject}.
  <DT><B>Identifiers</B>
  <DD>Identifiers may be mapped to instances of {@link de.cocolab.reuse.Ident} using
      an {@link de.cocolab.reuse.IdentTable}.  <code>Ident</code> objects are unique for
      a given input string, and are also numbered to give a convenient index into an array
      of identifier attributes.
  <DT><B>Error reporting</B>
  <DD>The {@link de.cocolab.reuse.Errors} class is needed by parsers generated with the
      parser generator <TT>lark</TT>.
      It can also be used to report error messages found during scanning or semantic
      analysis.
  <DT><B>Position</B>
  <DD>The class {@link de.cocolab.reuse.Position} is a simple representation of the
      position of tokens in a source file consisting of fields for line and column.
      This class can be subclassed or tailored to the user's needs, if necessary, for
      example to include the file name.
  <DT><B>IO</B>
  <DD>The classes {@link de.cocolab.reuse.CocktailReader} and
      {@link de.cocolab.reuse.CocktailWriter} provide input-output formatting facilities
      for Cocktail specific objects.
</DL>
