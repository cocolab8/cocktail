A Library of reusable Modula-2 Modules
======================================


To generate reuse use:

   make MC=<compiler>

There are a few machine dependencies. These are isolated in the file

   rSystem.c

which is written in C. The machine dependencies in the files

   rMemory.mi, Heap.mi, and DynArray.mi

are handled during runtime.
